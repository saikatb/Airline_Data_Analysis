# Airline_Data_Analysis

In this analysis we want to give a summary about all the parameters that contribute positively or negatively in order to come to a sound conclusion. 

This data set will contain the data which will give us a gist and the summary about below things : 

  1) The max number of flights flown from origin to destination
  2) Average velocity of the flights and the normal distribution of their speed
  3) Which boarding point in journey is mostly responsible in carrying maximum number of flights
  4) how several parameters are correlated among each other as far as pearson correlation coefficient is concerned.

The data of the data frames have been analyzed using python libraries i.e. pandas,numpy,matplotlib, seaborn and scikit learn
